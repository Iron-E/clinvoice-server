# CLInvoice

<!-- cargo-rdme start -->

`clinvoice-server` is WIP backend for CLInvoice libraries. It aims to allow any
number of different frontends, such as [CLInvoice](https://github.com/Iron-E/clinvoice) or
[GUInvoice](https://github.com/Iron-E/guinvoice), to communicate with it without having to be
written in Rust or re-implement common procedures.

## Usage

* For basic information, run `clinvoice-server help` from the command line.
* For an in-depth guide, see the [wiki](https://github.com/Iron-E/clinvoice-server/wiki/Usage).
