# winvoice-server

## Docker

A [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) is provided to run the application in an isolated environment. A database is not included in the image, but is required to start the server.

### Build

There are several options for building, depending on what you are comfortable with.

#### `docker build`

Run the following command:

```sh
docker build [--build-arg <arg>=<value> ...] [--tag <tag>] .
```

For example:

```sh
docker build --build-arg RUST_VERSION=1.75.0 --tag winvoice-server:latest .
```

##### Arguments

| Name           | Default  | Description                       |
| :--            | :--      | :--                               |
| `GID`          | `10001`  | The ID of the created group.      |
| `RUST_VERSION` | `1.76.0` | The Rust version to compile with. |
| `UID`          | `$GID`   | The ID of the created user.       |

#### `terraform`

Optionally, you can use [terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform) to set up the relevant containers:

```terraform
## main.tf
module "winvoice-server" {
	source = "path/to/winvoice-server"

	# optionally, specify build arguments
	build-args = {
		rust-version = "1.77.0"
	}
}

## extra config as necessaryâ€¦
```

Then, in a shell of your choice:

```sh
terraform init # setup
terraform apply # create winvoice-server containers
terraform destroy # delete winvoice-server containers
```

### Usage

After building, run:

```sh
docker run -p <port> <image-name> [<winvoice-server-arg> ...]
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> Use `docker exec` if you want to run a command inside a container rather than an image.

For example, to print help info, do:

```sh
docker run -p 3000 \
	-t \ # tty
	--rm \ # remove after executing
	<image-name> \
	help # run `winvoice-server help`
```

## Compose

A [compose file](./compose.yaml) is provided to run the application. A postgres image is included in the configuration.

Run the following command:

```sh
docker compose up
```
